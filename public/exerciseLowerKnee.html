        <p>
          When we talk about knee-dominant exercises, we are talking about lower body/ leg exercises where the primary element of the exercise involves the bending of the knee. This distinction is important, as most lower body exercises will involve bending at the knee as well as bending at the hip in the same movement, but it will be the extent of either that will determine whether the movement is a knee-dominant exercise or a hip-dominant one. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Knee-dominant movements build strength in the thigh/ quadriceps more than anything else, but will also strengthen the rest of the legs to a lesser extent too, particularly the hamstrings and glute muscles. The main exercise in this family of movements is the well known squat, although equally viable alternatives exist to work the legs.
        </p>
      <h3>The squat</h3>

        <img class="exercise-section-image" src="images/Pistol-squat.jpg" alt="A one-legged squat">
        <p>
          Almost as recognisable as the pushup, the squat is simply where you squat down with your lower body, and raise yourself again with your legs. A full-body powerhouse, the squat is a very effective exercise on many levels, and particularly so for the legs. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Initially, focus will be on two-legged forms of the movement, but like many other bodyweight exercises, in order to continue progressing when we reach more advanced levels, focus will then move onto one-legged versions of the movement.
        </p>
      <h3>Non-squat alternatives</h3>

        <img class="exercise-section-image" src="images/sprinting.jpg" alt="Sprinting">
        <p>
          Deep step-ups represent a viable alternative to squatting, where with one of your feet you simply step up onto a raised platform, and step back down again. Progression is managed through changing the height of the platform, as well as altering how much support the non-active foot provides.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sprinting is another great alternative option, and provide a powerful stimulus for growth and strength in the legs when incorporated into your bodyweight training programme. To lower some of the stresses on the joints, hill-sprints are an equally viable option, and an effective way to build strength in the posterior chain of the body also.

      <h3>I've been told one-legged squats are impossible!</h3>
        <p>
          While difficult and take time to achieve, they are very much possible. Like any advanced movement, you should not expect to be able to do them immediately, but rather to build up to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Typical of many advanced bodyweight movements, achieving a one-legged squat will force you to self-diagnose the areas of the movement you find problematic, so that you can overcome them and progress. 
        </p>
        <p>
          For many these areas will be flexibility-related, for others strength-related in an element of the rom (range of motion). 
        </p>
        <p>
          In conquering these weak points, you will not only conquer the pistol squat (one-legged squat), but also move closer to mastery over your own body by addressing these physical weaknesses.
        </p>
      <h3>Don't many bodyweight athletes train their legs with weights?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes. Some do, some don't, but training your legs with weights can be quite effective, especially once you surpass a certain level and find it more difficult to challenge your legs in the same way with just your own bodyweight.
        </p>
        <p>
          Weights are always an option, although to reach the point where one *needs* to use weights will take some time, and the time involved to reach one-legged squats can be a long one.
        </p>
        <p>
          While there is nothing set in stone that you must achieve a one-legged squat, what is without doubt is if you do, you can be assured of an able, flexible and strong lower body!
