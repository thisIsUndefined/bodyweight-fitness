          The core is what joins your upper and lower body, and while definitions of what constitutes the core can vary, anything that lies between the upper and lower halves of your body that cannot be definitively identified as either, shall be our definition of the core.
        <p>
          Training the core muscles can be approached in two fashions. The current fashion is for static holds when it comes to core training, but both approaches can be mixed and matched with equal success. Neither approach is inherently more/ less safe than the other, although it is important to observe decent exercise form to avoid lower back pain or other issues.  
        </p>
      <h3>Dynamic Movements</h3>

        <p>
          Any core exercises where there is a movement component, these are your situps/ crunches/ etc that most are familiar with when they imagine core training. Key families of exercises in this category include sit-ups and leg-raises respectively, although more intermediate and advanced core movements can be found in the form of exercises such as windshield wipers and dragon-flag progressions when such are needed.
        </p>
      <h3>Static Holds</h3>

          Static holds for core training have become immensely popular in recent times, with their proponents pointing to the functional role of the core muscles to resist movement in day-to-day life. The lack of spinal flexion in such movements thus reducing the potential for back injury is also stated as a key reason why static holds should find a place in your core training. Planks and hollow-body holds are key examples of static holds that are highly effective in training your core.

      <h3>Are dynamic core moves safe?</h3>
        <p>
          There is a school of thought that any core movements that involve flexing the spine are risky for the lower back. Given we flex our spine every day already, we would say this is an overly conservative school of thought, although can see it's validity when discussing the likes of situps and crunches done to excess. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Thankfully however we are long past the day where the common prescription for a strong core is several hundred/ thousand situps a day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bottomline? Treat your core like you would any other body part, where you challenge it in a progress manner. By doing so, if you can do an abundance of reps, you need to move up to a more challenging variation of the movement. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In training this way, we can't see there would be a need to eliminate dynamic core moves from your training.
        </p>
      <h3>What does hollow body mean?</h3>
        <p>
          Hollow body refers to maintaining the position of your lower back in a certain way, so any unnecessary load is taken off the lower back and instead transferred to the abdominal muscle. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In doing so, we ensure activation of the abdominal muscles, and also through keeping our core taut and solid that any force transferred between our upper and lower bodies (or vice versa) is done so efficiently.
        </p>
        <p>
          This should illustrate the importance of the core muscles, and also why the position we hold our back in during the hollow-hold is important to maintain while we train our core in any way.
