          Often ignored in the past, your diet and nutrition will prove key elements of how successful your fitness endeavours shall be. While how you work out will determine things like how strong you are, how quickly you can produce that power, and for how long, how you eat will determine key elements like how quickly and well you recover from your training exertions as well as your body composition and how you body adds muscle tone and sheds excess fat.
        </p>
      <h3>Quantity and quality</h3>
        <p>At the most basic level, how much you eat and the quality of what you eat will determine the quality of your diet and the nourishment your body receives. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition how much you eat when weighed against how much your body needs will determine whether you lose, maintain, or gain weight. The quality of what you've eaten will then play a large role in how well your body runs.
        </p>
        <p>
          The total energy your body receives from your food, ie the quantity element, is reflected by how many calories it contains. These calories are composed of varying levels of macronutrients (protein, carbohydrate, fat and alcohol), which will reflect how effective what you've just eaten is for repair and maintenance, as well as energy. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Micronutrients then reflect how well the food you've eaten satisfies your bodies needs for vitamins, minerals and other nutrients essential for its essential functions.
        </p>
        </p>
        <h3>'Clean' eating</h3>    
        <p>
          A relatively controversial term, 'clean' eating to us is simply the quality level of what you eat in terms of the micronutrients it provides to your body. The quality of your diet and how well it meets your bodies needs will directly correlate with how well your body runs.
        </p>
        <h3>Sugar</h3>
        <p>
          Another hotly contested topic given the damaging effects of excess sugar on health (type 2 diabetes) and bodies (burgeoning waistlines), the important word to observe here is the word <em>excess</em>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          As further evidence emerges with regard to the exact health effects of sugar, the currently fuzzy picture regarding sugar may become clearer. For now however, the most important aspect of sugar from a dietary fitness point of view, will be the effects it may have on how well you adhere to your desired diet.

          The overall amount of energy in our food, a crude but effective measure.

        <p>
          Simply the element of what you eat that contains the raw materials your body uses for repair and growth.
        </p>
      <h3>Fat</h3>
        <p>
          One of the two energy components of your food, fat calories are slowly digested and thus provide a slow-releasing energy for your body as well as providing other elements necessary for your bodies essential processes.
        </p>
      <h3>Carbohydrates</h3>
        <p>
          The other energy component of food. More quickly processed than fat, carbohydrate is able to be used by your body to fuel the most intense of activities. 
        </p>
      <h3>Fibre</h3>
        <p>
          An element of carbohydrate, fibre will usually determine how quickly the carbohydrate you eat can be converted to energy by your body.
