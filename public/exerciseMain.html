          Before delving into the exercises themselves, we just wish to take a moment to discuss some basics of bodyweight resistance training. Some elements will be familiar to those used to other forms of resistance training, some will be specific to bodyweight training itself. 
        </p>        
      <h3>Compound movements, progression and leverage</h3>
        <p>
          With bodyweight training, it is quite difficult to isolate specific areas and muscles, so most of the time you will be utilising compound movements. Compound movements can be defined as any exercise that engages two or more different joints to fully stimulate entire muscle groups and multiple muscles. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In bodyweight exercising, we moderate the difficulty of the exercises we do mainly through the selection of easier or more difficult variations of an exercise. In doing so, we are manipulating the leverage of an exercise and how much of our bodyweight we are forcing our body to support in that variation of the exercise.

      <h3>Exercise movement families</h3>
        <p>
          With resistance training of any sort, we are concerned with the larger family of movement patterns that we are exercising and strengthening so we can ensure we are training in a balanced way to prevent imbalances and weaknesses from developing. 
        <p>
          The main movement patterns we are concerned with in calisthenics are those of pushing and pulling when it comes to the upper body, whether a movement is knee or hip-dominant when it comes to the lower body, and finally the core is a family of movements that all pertain to the trunk of our bodies that connect our upper and lower bodies.
        </p>
      <h3>Reps, sets and form</h3>
        <p>
          Common to all forms of resistance training, a rep is the number of times you perform a specific exercise, and a set is the number of cycles of reps that you complete. Thus if you do ten pushups, you've just done one set of ten reps. Form then refers to the quality of each one of those reps, and if you've done it with 'good form'. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Form becomes important to ensure you are reaping the maximum benefits from each rep, as well as also guarding against injury by ensuring muscular imbalances do not develop. Equally good form will help ensure you do not injure yourself by unintentionally placing too much pressure on parts of your body that are untrained to take such pressure.

      <h3>What do I need to start?</h3>
        <p>
          Not much - just you and a pullup bar really. Everything else can be done with a floor, wall, or chair for the most part, making bodyweight exercising as accessible as athletics for the most part. 
        </p>
        <p>
          We won't even make you buy an expensive pair of runners!
        </p>
      <h3>Can I build muscle with calisthenics?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes. Muscle growth is stimulated when we push our muscles past what they can manage. This is called overload, and when we do it continually over time, it is progressive overload. 
        <p>
        </p>
          Progressive overload drives muscle growth, and can be achieved with bodyweight just as it is with weights.
        </p>
        <p>
          The takeaway point is that we will continue to improve in areas in which we continue to challenge ourselves (as long as we allow ourselves recovery time to permit that growth process to happen).
        </p>
      <h3>Are weights not just better?</h3>
        <p>
          Weights make it more straightforward to increase the difficulty of a movement by making the weight we are lifting heavier. Beyond this aspect, the results from our training are dependent on how we challenge our bodies!
