        <p>
          The counterpart to the knee-dominant movements of our lower body training, hip-dominant movements build power and strength in the hips, glutes, and hamstrings. Besides balanced lower body strength, building strength and power in the hips and posterior chain will be of particular importance to sporting and combat athletes, where the hips contribute strongly to the production of power in their sports.

      <h3>Hip bridges</h3>

        <p>
          A body of movements where the focus is on thrusting the hips when the body is horizontal (on a mat) or almost horizontal (shoulders supported on a bench). Weighted variations exist also, but given we're concerned with bodyweight, the types of movements are made more difficult through how much support is offered by the feet, and whether we do the movement supported with one foot on the ground or two.
        </p>
      <h3>Single leg deadlifts</h3>
        <img class="exercise-section-image" src="images/singleLegDeadlift.jpg" alt="A (weighted) single leg deadlift">
        <p>
          With this movement, we replicate a pulling movement from the floor, akin to the deadlifting exercise. While we can't replicate a weighted deadlift with just our bodyweight; weighted deadlifts often call for a weight that can be several times ones bodyweight, we can adapt the movement. 
        </p>
        <p>
          With the single-legged deadlift, we do that by making it a single limb movement (we support ourselves on just one of our legs). The result is a movement that challenges our balance and flexibility, as well as our strength.

      <h3>What is the posterior chain?</h3>
        <p>
          The posterior chain simply means the chain of muscles at the rear of your body. This is generally where the majority of power is generated in the body, and we tend to talk of the back, glute, and hamstring muscles primarily when we talk of the posterior chain.
        </p>
        <p>
          To illustrate how important the posterior chain muscles are in generating force with our bodies, we just need to look at the central role of the hips when a boxer throws a punch for example. All the power is generated by the hips, the arm just delivers it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Likewise, when we see particularly strong tackles in sports like rugby or American football, it is the explosive power in the hips where all that force is generated.
        </p>
        <p>
          The counterpart to the posterior chain is the anterior chain - the muscle groups at the front of the body. These often tend to be the visually and visibly impressive muscles in someones physique, despite the fact the 'engine-room' of the body when it comes to force generation is in the rear. 
        </p>
        <p>
          For all the above reasons, one can see the importance in training both the posterior chain (rear muscle groups) as well as the anterior chain (front muscle groups).
