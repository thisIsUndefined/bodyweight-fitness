      <h3>Why calisthenics?</h3>
        <p>
          We generally find those engaged in bodyweight or calisthenic training to be a curious and broad-ranging bunch. Below are some of the things that brought others to calisthenics.
        <p>
          Maybe you're:
          <ul>
            <li>looking for an accessible, low cost way to get and stay fit</li>
            <li>weary of the gym and long to be outdoors more</li>
            <li>seeking a brand of resistance training that will allow you to build your flexibility and strength of your joints and connective tissues as well as simpler brute strength</li>
            <li>injured and wish to use calisthenics to rehabilitate and strengthen your body</li>
            <li>looking for something to tick the resistance training 'box' to accompany your other pursuits</li>
            <li>considering calisthenics for some equally awesome reason!</li>
          </ul>

      <h3>Calisthenics or bodyweight?</h3>
        <p>
          'Calisthenics' comes from the Greek <em>kallos</em> for beauty, and <em>sthenos</em> for strength. It's an older and similar term to bodyweight training, and you will be seeing both used interchangeably on the site
        </p>
      <h3>Speaking of other cool pursuits..</h3>
        <p>
          Us calisthenists tend to be a curious bunch, and you'll tend to find our community full of those who are also climbers, gymnasts, free-runners, weight lifters, powerlifters, strongmen/ strongwomen, runners, endurance athletes, slackliners, yoga practitioners, movement enthusiasts, and more
