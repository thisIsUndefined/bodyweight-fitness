      <h3>Self-Exploration</h3>
        <p>
          The materials and links on these pages give direction as to your training and nutrition, but you will undoubtedly find the greatest knowledge you shall acquire shall be from your own self experimentation and exploration. 
        </p> 
        <p>
          Scientific studies can help show what has been proven for larger proportions of groups, but it pays to scrutinise the basis on which such studies were conducted and cross-reference them against other such studies. 
        </p>
        <p>
          It is also worth bearing in mind that even the most conclusive and well conducted studies can only reliably predict what will happen in a group of individuals. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Only you shall be able to discover what works best for you individually!
